// Steps to start a backend application

1. create a private repo and clone it 
2. git clone ssh-url
3. cd folderName and code . which opens vs code
4. npm init or npm init -y
5. create a file name .gitignore and add in that node_modules
6. create a file called app.js (touch app.js)
7. add "type":"module" in package.json anywhere at any line with , comma
8. Install all the packages which you need 
Ex : npm install readline-sync chalk dotenv 
npm install ==> It will check all packages from package.json and install packages



// sudo code // steps to write in any file using fs 

1. make sure when you or user press 1  it calls register function 
// check it by a console.log
2. also make sure its correctly imported and exported 
// if single fuction ==> export default fuctionName
// if multple function => export {fun1,fun2}
// if multple import {fun1,fun2} from "./user/index.js"
3. then ask from user , register details 
example : username,password using readline-sync 
// also make sure readline package is installed
4. fetch data from db.json ==> which gives output in string format
5. convert that string format js code using JSON.parse()
example : let arr = `[2,3,5,6,5]`  
6. store username and password in a object;
7. and final step when you write in file again it should be in string format



1. take data from json in string;
2.convert that data to js code parse
3. do your code operation exmaple array method  push
4. convert your code to string
